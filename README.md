# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project #2

This was a group project that involved extracting 3 different files, transforming & cleaning the data to the desired format for the final tables, and then exporting those files to csv.  Once the files were created, a database design was sketched, variables & their types identified as well as primary and foreign keys, and then written into a schema files.  A crowding database was created in PostGres and the schema query run to load the table structure.  Finally, the data from the earlier created csvs was then loaded into the tables.

Included in the project resposity is:
1. jupyter notebook used to extract, transform, and export the csv files
2. the original data and the 4 exported csvs
3. an ERD sketch and resulting table schema
4. snapshots of the loaded tables in PostGres database
